This will eventually be a separate project so we can give this 
away as a complete solution for all tomboy suppport.

This can be used to build tomboy like (note taking) capabilities into another
app as it will fully support the tomboy file format xml file as well as
normal operations such as making a new note, deleting a note, searching,
and much, much more.
