5. search window from note.

8. change app name (and kde data path) to ktomgirl

9. get a icon of delete note into the tool bar

10. implement delete note as a test

11. get the proper number of notes to be saved, we always revert back to "note 1" for some reason.

13. slot delete note
	a. hook up signal
	b. delete file
	c. remove from search list
	d. remove from knotes list
	e. remove from notemanager list

14. Better support for name changed which updates the search window faster when the title changes

15. Deal with line breaks in the title better especially when starting a new note. Perhaps we should ban, somehow, linebreaks in the title

16. When the title changes, check to see if we have a note that has that title and disallow notes with the same name

17. context window in the search window

18. non-blinking curor

19. link support 
a. when we type in the name of a note 
b. when we click on "make link" button

d. when we load note as metadata
e. when we 

20. respect other metadata in the note such as cursor position and window size and if a note was open when we last quit

21. systray support 

22. test quit support better--make sure we save in each case  

23. ruby dev tools (starboard tools):
	a. check for dead functions which are never called
	b. mkstubsfromfile.rb which turns a normal file into stubs for faster porting by removing method bodies
	e. libstarboard which does things like find all the functions in a .cpp file for use in other programs

24. libtomgirl
	a. move all files to libtomgirl dir and link from there
	b. remove qt code from libtomgirl files
	c. compile standalone libtomgirl lib and link later to tomgirl
